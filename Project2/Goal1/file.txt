A four-pound rock that left Mars 16 million years ago may hold the clues to ancient life on the planet. The rock is one of 13 Mars meteorites found on Earth. These rocks may contain clues to the ancient history of planet Mars, believed to have been a warmer, wetter place over 3 billion years ago. NASA's planetary scientists tell us why they think the Mars rock contains evidence of ancient life.
